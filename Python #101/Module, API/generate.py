import random

# example 1
# coin = random.choice(["heads", "tails"])
# print(coin)
# ouput: either heads or tails

# example 2
# from random import choice
# coin = choice(["heads", "tails"])
# print(coin)
# the difference is that you don't have to write random.choice, you can just write choice

# example 3
# number = random.randint(1, 10)
# print(number)
# output: a random number between 1 and 10

# example 4
# cards = ["Q", "K", "A"]
# random.shuffle(cards)
# for card in cards:
#     print(card)
# used to shuffle a list
# output: Q, K, A in random order
